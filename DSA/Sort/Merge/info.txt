Merge Sort is one of the most important sorting algorithms in DSA, and it introduces divide-and-conquer. Letâ€™s go through a description first, then implementations in Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.

ðŸŒ€ Merge Sort
ðŸ“– Description

Type: Divide & Conquer algorithm.

Idea:
Divide the array into halves recursively until each subarray has 1 element.
Merge subarrays while sorting them.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n) (extra space for merging).

Stability: âœ… Stable (does not change the relative order of equal elements).

ðŸ“Œ When to use?
When guaranteed O(n log n) is required.
Works great for linked lists and when stability matters.
